- Radiant flux (or power): total amount of energy passing through a surface (measured per second).
$$Radiant flux: \Delta [W] \; or \; [J/s]$$

What to measure in a simulation?
Solution: compute the flux y unit area (irradiance)
$$Irradiance: E[W/m^2]$$

Solution: compute the flux by unit area and unit angle. --> **answer**!
$$Radiance: L[W/(m^2 \cdot sr)]$$
